### ü•á Performance

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/PerformanceBlock.svg)

LittleLink epitomizes simplicity and minimalism. When evaluating the [LittleLink sample page](https://littlelink.io/sample/seth) (which mirrors a typical LittleLink setup for an individual) through tools such as [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-littlelink-io-sample-seth/17ex80ryq4?form_factor=mobile), showcases LittleLink's excellence with 100/100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. My initial vision for LittleLink was to craft it from the fundamentals. I chose [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) as the foundation, enabling me to create something minimal and quick, removing the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy

![Publish](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/Deployment.svg)

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work‚Äîit uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify) using the button below. LittleLink is also easy to host through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or on your home lab server, CDN, or other frontend hosting services. To edit, all you need is a little basic HTML knowledge to add a link to the exisiting buttons or you can create your own. See our [adding custom buttons to your own fork wiki](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink/wiki/Adding-custom-buttons-to-your-own-fork). It's simple, promise. ü§û
